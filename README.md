**Project 5** : Customer Segmentation for a marketplace platform

## Project Description:

Implementation of an unsupervised classification algorithm to perform a customer segmentation on a marketplace database

* Creation of a data cleaning/consolidation pipeline
* Train and compare several clustering algorithms (Kmeans, GaussianMixtureModel, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN)
* Create Cluster Evaluation Function (notably for interpretability)
* Evaluate stability over time of our clusters

Dataset used : <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce'>Data E-commerce</a>

## Assessed Skills:

* Adapt unsupervised algorithm's hyperparameters to enhance its performances
* Evaluate performances of a unsupervised algorithm
* Transform features appropriately to use them in an unsupervised learning algorithm
* Implement a sector-specific relevant unsupervised machine learning model
